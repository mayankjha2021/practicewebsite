    <h1>Blockchain</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <P><i>For other uses, see Block chain (disambiguation).</i></P>
    <P>A <B>blockchain</B> is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.<BR>[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves).<BR> Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it.<br> Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.<BR></P>
    <P><mark>Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network</mark> for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks.<br> Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.<BR>[5</P>

        <h3>Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:[</h3>
        <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
        <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation[25] and verification)</li>
        <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
        <li>data (blocks, transactions)</li>
        <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)</li>
